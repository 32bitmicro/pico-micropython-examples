= Using UART on the Raspberry Pi Pico
:xrefstyle: short

Send data from the UART1 port to the UART0 port. 

== Other code to try
[source.python]
uart0 = UART(0) #opens a UART connection at the default baudrate of 115,200
uart0.readline() #reads until the CR (\r) and NL (\n) characters then returns the line
